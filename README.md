View Expenses
‚ö†Ô∏è
Points to Note:
This page is accessible to both Members and Admins. Members can only access their own data, while Admins can access data for all users.
Both Admins and Members can only update or delete expenses that they have created. Even Admins cannot update or delete expenses created by other users.

The "View Expenses" page should contain a data table with the following columns:
Column Name
Remarks
Name
Category
Date of Expense
Amount
Updated at
Created by
Show ‚Äúme‚Äù if Expense is created by the Logged-in user, otherwise show the User‚Äôs Email.
Action buttons
Edit and Delete buttons (use icons)
Each row in the data table represents an expense request.
If expenses were not created by the logged-in user (applies to admins), they will not see the Edit or Delete option.
The "Filter by Date" option, which includes a date picker, allows to filter the list of expenses based on the date of the expense request.
The "Search by Expense Name" function allows to search for expenses in the list by their name.
Editing Expenses
Editing an expense will use the same functionality as creating an expense form. The form will be displayed in a modal with existing data pre-filled, allowing users to make updates and save changes.
The "Created by" and "Created at" values will not update if an expense is edited.
Deleting Expenses
When deleting an expense, a confirmation prompt will be shown before the object is deleted from the database.
Users
‚ö†Ô∏è
Points to Note:
UI Pages are not required for creating, updating, and deleting users. The default Django Admin page can be used instead.
To achieve the required login functionality, you can extend the default Django Users model if necessary.
Roles
The Admin Role can be implemented by setting the is_admin flag to True in the Users Model. 
However, you are free to choose the implementation design for Roles to meet the requirement stated in  section.
